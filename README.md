# Fund Operations Analytics Dashboard

This project demonstrates **operational analytics for fund services** through a **dashboard-style analysis** of simulated fund transaction data.  
It highlights **key performance indicators (KPIs)**, **transaction throughput**, **SLA compliance**, **variance analysis**, and **capacity utilization**.

---

## Project Overview

Fund Services and Middle Office teams process high volumes of transactions daily. This project simulates transaction data to provide:

- **Operational KPIs**: Total transactions, average processing time, SLA compliance, average daily throughput
- **Throughput Analysis**: Track daily transaction volumes
- **SLA Performance**: Compliance percentage by transaction type
- **Variance & Bottleneck Analysis**: Identify potential operational bottlenecks
- **Capacity Utilization**: Monitor operational limits and resource usage

The analysis supports **data-driven decision-making**, **process optimization**, and **reporting accuracy**.
